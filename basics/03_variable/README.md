# Variables

This chapter belongs to the **Basics** section and introduces **variables** in Python.

Variables are the foundation of all Python programs. They allow you to store values, reuse them, and change program behavior over time. In this chapter, you will learn how variables are created, how they are named, how they relate to values, and how they are commonly used in Python code.

The goal is to build a clear mental model of variables before moving on to data types, control flow, and functions.
